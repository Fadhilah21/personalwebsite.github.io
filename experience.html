<p align="center"> <font face="consolas" font size="5"> This is my experience's story. 
<br>
To be honest, I do have many experience and sometimes experience do have affect my life's style.
<br> 
Sometimes I can called that good experience and sometimes not.
<br> 
There are many types of experience, some of them we can called experience that lead people's life style, 
some of them also we called just experience 
to leave a memories, and some of them called an experience that we cannot do that again.
<br>
My personal view of experience is <i> experience always leading someone's life. </i> 
<br> 
I think without experience I cannot live in this world as experience do greatly affect my way of 
living but in this section I will not talk about
an experience that make me lead my life this way.
<br> 
Instead I will talk about memories that leave a trace of memories.

I go to Perlis-Thailand border called Padang Besar. I go there with my mother's school trip by bus.
Instead of my mother, I and my aunt go there. Padang Besar is a place that 
like a shopping complex with affordable price. Usually, based on what I listening to, 
people always go there to buy comforter. So, I also buy it. As it border with Thailand, then a 
Thailand-food is so delicious at there. Their tomyam pest also 
delicious. One day, I will definetely go there again.
<br>
<br>
...I also hope that after this pandemic, I can go there to explore the Perlis more as I heard that their smango named Harum Manis is so popular in there.

At there, we swim in the river, hiking at nearest hill (only half) and others. To be honest, I dont remember my full trip except this two. Maybe, this two activities 
leave a great memories to me. In this camp, we need to sleep at tent. For me, this is a fun things to do.

<br>
<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... Among to the other state, Melaka is my favourite ones. It is because as I love history so Melaka is a place who

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> Terengganu Darul Iman </li></b>
<br>
<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... I go to this state is when I am 7 years old and with my aunt following my village's trip. We go there by busses. 
From what I remember, I do visit a batik's factory and thats all. Not so much to tell, but I think I do enjoy it a lot. If not because of pandemic, 
then in this year, 2020, I will go there with my family following my mother's last school trip. But it's okay about that. There will be another chance
for me to go there in future. Hopefully, InsyaAllah. 
</font>
</p>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> Kelantan Darul Naim </li></b>
<br>
<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... Lastly, Kelantan. I have been to Kelantan twice in my life. First is on 2016. I go there with my hostel's trip.
At there, we do visit a Wakaf Che Yeh, Pasar Siti Khadijah, Kelantan's Palace, Batik's museum, Pantai Cahaya Bulan and others. It is such a good experience
as we all of the girls sleep in homestay that requires you to walk a few minutes to go to night market. As it homestay, so there are cooking's tools.
As Kelantan is popular with its Keropok Lekor, than senior and junior do take a turn to fry the Keropok Lekor, and later we eat together in evening.
It is such a memorable experience for me. 
<br>
<br>
... My seconds visit is on 2018 where I go there by car with my friend and his father's workers. As her father works at 
<abbr title="Pihak Berkuasa Kemajuan Pekebun Kecil Perusahaan Getah"> RISDA </abbr>, there are a courses that organized by them. As I know her and I am available 
when she ask me, so we go there for almost three days and two nights. At there, there are variabe of courses available and I got 'Teknik Perniagaan Secara Online' 
different from my friends. Although we stay at same house but we we stay at different room. I stay with two friends and unluckily for me, they are smoking.
So my among memorable experience at there is living in small room full of smoke smell. To be honest I dont like the smoke smell but even they're smoking, but
they are truly kind of people and easy to talk to. Besides we attend the courses, they also bring us to nights market in last night. There is also funny 
story yet sad is when we're on the way to Kelantan, we need to drive along Banjaran Titiwangsa (where there is a long driving but full of beautiful scenary).
We do not stop to eat before we drive to Banjaran Titiwangsa with the hope to eat at restaurant along the way. Unluckily, the restaurant is close so we just
take a rest and use the toilet only. Back to restaurant story, we need to strain ourself from hunger until we almost up to the courses's place.

<br>
<p align="center"> <font face="consolas" font size="5">
I hope that one day I will able go to Sabah and Sarawak before travelling overseas. 
<br> 
To be honest, all of this memories are valuable to me eventhough there is stories that I missing out.
<br> 
All of this experiences, I will truly treasures until the day I forgot or anything related to my brain happen.
